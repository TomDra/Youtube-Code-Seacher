# youtube-code-searcher

This code was created for KSI's Laugh and give money video's e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L69Wt-5d8rE

 - You need to install Tesseract and place it in a folder called "ignore-tesseract" in the main directory
 - Get a twillio account and put the credentials in the config file
 - Add a Discord webhook to the config file

This code is very messy with limited documentation.

It worked for nearly all of KSI's code video's except his newest (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBXcEO6t2Ok) where he changed the way he displayed the codes and I do not have the time to update the code.
